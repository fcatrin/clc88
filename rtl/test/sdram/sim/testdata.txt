This is a test data file for read and write from or to memory.
More and more text to check if writing back and evictions
are working as expected. Here is more text so we can test that
eviction or replacement of lines work. It seems that more
text is required to fill the 256 bytes that the whole cache
can hold.

The Unix epoch (or Unix time or POSIX time or Unix timestamp)
is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970
(midnight UTC/GMT), not counting leap seconds
(in ISO 8601: 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). Literally speaking the epoch
is Unix time 0 (midnight 1/1/1970), but 'epoch' is often used as a
synonym for Unix time. Some systems store epoch dates as a signed
32-bit integer, which might cause problems on January 19, 2038
(known as the Year 2038 problem or Y2038). The converter on this
page converts timestamps in seconds (10-digit), milliseconds (13-digit)
and microseconds (16-digit) to readable dates.
